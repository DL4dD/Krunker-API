# Krunker User Stats API
This web application is based as an introduction to background worker processes in Heroku, which can be found at the [Heroku Devcenter](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-rq).
This application can be easily deployed to Heroku with NO SETUP NEEDED.

To test out the API: go here

Example: https://yoururl.herokuapp.com/?name=nameofuser

The API will return all of the specified user results.

I've also added app.json and this readme so you can:
